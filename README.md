# IronHacks Server Application

Hack for innovation to solve global challenges.

## About

IronHacks is an open data hacking program that combines experiential learning with real-world data-driven problem solving. During a 5-stage virtual competition, students utilize open data to create novel and useful interactive visualizations and analytic "apps" that solve civic challenges.

During an iterative multiphase process, the competing participants have access to tutorials, standardized libraries and packages, and virtual help sessions. After each phase, submissions are being evaluated within a few hours or days with the help of machine intelligence and human experts. Real time and targeted feedback accelerate learning and facilitate participants in hacking complex problems.
