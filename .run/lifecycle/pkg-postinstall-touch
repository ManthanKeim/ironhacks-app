## LOTS OF FILES INCLUDED IN NPM MODULES HAVE WRONG OR MESSED UP
## PERMISSIONS OR FILE ATTRIBUTES (ATIME/CTIME)
##
## ITS NOT CLEAR WHAT THE IMPACT OF INCONSISTENCIES ARE WITHIN A PROJECT
## BUT FIXING THEM AS SOON AS A FILE IS INSTALLED LETS US RUN A FEW
## MANAGEMENT COMMANDS WITH MUCH BETTER CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WORK THE WAY
## WE EXPECT / AND WITHOUT SKIPPING SOME FILE THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS CREATED
## 60 YEARS AGO.
##

# SHOULD RUN AS A POST-INSTALL HOOK BUT WE CAN MAKE THE MIN TIME VARIABLE IF NEEDED
# cmin -10 -- file changed less than ten minutes ago

# SIMPLY TOUCHING THE FILE IS ENOUGH TO MODIFY THE FILES CTIME AND THE ATIME 
find node_modules/ -type f -cmin -10 -exec touch {} \;
